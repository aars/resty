# TODOs and considerations

* There must be a better/cleaner way to replace special chars with codes.

  Maybe use an external lib? (Perl/Python?)

# TODOs from code

* `133   ┆ ┆ ┆ # TODO; try adapt ; echo "$opt" | grep '^-[a-zA-Z]*v[a-zA-Z]*$' >/dev/null)`
  I have no idea what this is supposed to do :)

* `138   ┆ ┆ ┆ -W);; # §todo: check why nothing?`
  Check for `-W` usage in call (after sourcing)
